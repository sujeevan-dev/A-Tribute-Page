		<h3>Early Days</h3>
			<p>On the 13th of October 1884 marks the birth of the instrumental human being who implemented the free education system of Sri Lanka. Christopher William Wijekoon Kannangara was born to an average family where his father lost his job when he was 12. Young Kannangara, who was courageous, underwent his early education at Weslyan High School at Ambalangoda & worked hard to gain a scholarship to enter Richmond College, Galle. Richmond College was a school for rich boys; Kannangara, who was poor, accomplished himself with great difficulties to complete his studies. At this time Kannangara's family of six children was struggling to survive.</p>
			<br />
		<h3>Moulding life with experiences</h3>
			<p>Although Kannangara was poor, he was an outstanding student in both academics & sports. He never knew that the experiences he gained as a poor child in Richmond College will induce him to battle so gallantly for free education, later in his life.</p>	
			<br />
		<h3>A great son of the nation</h3>
			<p>C. W. W. Kannangara entered the national arena as an activist of the Temperance movement initiated by patriots like F. R. Senanayake, Sir Baron Jayatilleka, Arthur V. Dias and Piyadasa Sirisena. In the 1930`s when P. de S. Kularatne, G. P. Malalasekera and others introduced the national dress he followed them and appeared in the national costume. Since then he never donned the Western costume. At this time the people who donned the national costume were humiliated.</p>
			<br />
		<h3>Minister of Education</h3>
			<br />
			<p>In 1924 he was elected to the Legislative Council to represent the Galle District. During his tenure in office as the Minister of Education in the State Council from 1931 to 1947, he introduced Free mid-day meal for school children, rapid development in Pirivena education (Education based on temples), inauguration of the University of Peradeniya and the introduction of Central schools. These were some of the goodwill gestures towards the betterment of the Education System during his term in office, in addition to the implementation of the Free Education Scheme.
			The Bill containing the Free Education scheme was introduced on the 30th of May 1944. University education was restricted to the most privileged strata of the society.The least privileged strata of the society had to be satisfied only with secondary education. This opportune proposal was made by the committee headed by C.W.W. Kannangara.</p>
			<br />
		<h3>Heavy Opposition</h3>
			<p>Amidst heavy oppositions, backed especially by the Catholic Church, Minister Kannangara faced many arguments which came against the free education system. The majority of the public questioned why free education should be extended to the privileged & affluent strata of the society. But C. W. W. Kannangara, who had to undergo many difficulties and having being harassed as a poor student, explained that he did not want to have class segregation in education and create a conflict among students by introducing Free Education Scheme. The Free Education cemented the way to bulldoze the inequality which existed in the Sri Lankan Society.
			C.W.W. Kannangara determinedly explained the benefits of free education to the masses and generated a strong public opinion in its favour. C. W. W. Kannangara then won over the majority of members in the assembly and saw the Free Education Scheme passed in the State Council.
			Since then Education was made free from kindergarten to the University.</p>
			<br />
		<h3>Tears of joy</h3>
			<p>Those poverty stricken but clever children earlier had only a bleak future to reap the benefits of higher education. The parents of those least privileged children, who could not even think of giving higher education for their clever children overwhelmed with joy when the Free Education Scheme was introduced.</p>
			<br />
		<h3>True Gentleman</h3>
			<p>C. W. W. Kannangara lost his seat at the parliamentary election in 1947. This was the first Parliamentary Elections held after he introduced the Free Education Scheme. But he was a true gentleman who took defeat so humbly & never ever moaned about it. Though he got defeated he didn't stop helping schools. He continued with his giant endeavour with eminent courage.</p>
			<br />
		<h3>Fruitful results</h3>
			<p>There are administrative officers, doctors, engineers, accountants, architects, lawyers and judges who hail from amongst the less privileged and humble citizens of the country merely as a result of the Free Education System. C.W.W. Kannangara was very fortunate to see fruitful results just in front of his eyes.</p>
			<br />
		<h3> Educational Reforms</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Education should be free from the Kindergarten to the University.</li>
				<li>The mother tongue should be used as the medium of instruction in the Primary Schools</li>
				<li>English should be taught in all schools from standard III.</li>
				<li>A curriculum for the child which would develop its "head, heart and hands" should be introduced. In other words, the education of the emotions is as necessary as the education of intellect and practical ability for the well-being of the child.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
		<p><strong><em>Students of mother Lanka are in debt to this personality who opened up the avenues to education. Solely because of his initiative, children of Sri Lanka still make use of the Free Education.</em></strong></p>
